# Solved/Unsolved Filter Implementation

## âœ… Backend Integration Complete

### API Endpoints Used:

1. **All Questions**: `POST /submission/questions`
   - Returns all questions for a category (regardless of solved status)
   - Response: `{ success: true, data: { questions: [...] } }`

2. **Solved Questions**: `POST /submission/solved`
   - Returns only questions the user has correctly solved
   - Response: `{ success: true, data: { questions: [...] } }`
   - Includes `solved_at` timestamp

3. **Unsolved Questions**: `POST /submission/un-solved`
   - Returns questions not yet solved (incorrect attempts + never attempted)
   - Response: `{ success: true, data: { unsolvedQuestions: [...] } }`
   - Includes `status` field: `'attempted_incorrect'` or `'never_attempted'`

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Filter Switching
```javascript
// Filter changes automatically reload questions from backend
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedCategory) {
    loadQuestions(selectedCategory, solvedFilter);
  }
}, [selectedCategory, solvedFilter]);
```

### 2. Smart Endpoint Selection
```javascript
switch (filter) {
  case 'Solved':
    response = await fetchSolvedQuestions(categoryId);
    break;
  case 'Unsolved':
    response = await fetchUnsolvedQuestions(categoryId);
    break;
  case 'All':
  default:
    response = await fetchQuestionsByCategory(categoryId);
    break;
}
```

### 3. Visual Indicators

**Solved Questions:**
- âœ… Green border around card
- âœ… "âœ“ Solved" badge in top-right corner
- Shows when filter is set to "Solved"

**Unsolved with Attempts:**
- âœ— Red "âœ— Attempted" badge
- Shows for questions with `status: 'attempted_incorrect'`
- Only visible in "Unsolved" filter

### 4. Summary Header
```
[Category Name] - [All/Solved/Unsolved] Challenges
X challenges found
```

Shows current filter state and result count

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### Filter Dropdown
```jsx
<select value={solvedFilter} onChange={(e) => setSolvedFilter(e.target.value)}>
  <option>All</option>
  <option>Solved</option>
  <option>Unsolved</option>
</select>
```

### Visual Badges on Cards
```jsx
{solvedFilter === 'Solved' && (
  <div style={{ background: '#10b981', color: '#fff' }}>
    âœ“ Solved
  </div>
)}

{solvedFilter === 'Unsolved' && question.status === 'attempted_incorrect' && (
  <div style={{ background: '#ef4444', color: '#fff' }}>
    âœ— Attempted
  </div>
)}
```

## ðŸ“Š User Experience Flow

1. **User selects "All"**
   - Fetches all questions from category
   - Shows total available questions
   - No special badges

2. **User selects "Solved"**
   - Fetches only solved questions
   - Cards have green border
   - "âœ“ Solved" badge on each card
   - Shows count of solved questions

3. **User selects "Unsolved"**
   - Fetches unsolved questions (never attempted + incorrect)
   - Questions with wrong attempts show "âœ— Attempted" badge
   - Questions never attempted show no badge
   - Shows count of remaining challenges

## ðŸ”„ Real-time Updates

When a user solves a question:
- AnswerSolving page marks question as solved
- User returns to Challenge page
- Filters automatically reflect new solved status
- Question moves from "Unsolved" to "Solved" when filters are reapplied

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

âœ… **Accurate Data**: All counts come from backend (not client-side guessing)  
âœ… **Real-time**: Always shows current solved status  
âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for solved/attempted questions  
âœ… **User Progress**: Easy to see what's completed and what remains  
âœ… **Category-specific**: Solved status filtered by selected category
